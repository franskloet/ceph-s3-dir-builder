# Example 4: Bob-Specific Access to Experiment Folder
# This demonstrates granting another user access to the same folder
# 
# Run after example-policy-additive-1.yaml and example-policy-additive-2.yaml
# 
# Result: 
# - Researchers group keeps its read access from config 1
# - Alice keeps her full access from config 2
# - Bob gets additional full access via user policy
# - All policies coexist independently

# What happens:
# 
# After running configs 1, 2, and 4:
#
# GROUP POLICIES:
#   researchers group:
#     - s3-team-storage-projects-experiment-2024 (read)
#
# USER POLICIES:
#   alice user:
#     - s3-team-storage-projects-experiment-2024 (full)
#   bob user:
#     - s3-team-storage-projects-experiment-2024 (full)
#
# EFFECTIVE ACCESS for experiment-2024:
# - Alice: FULL (via user policy)
# - Bob: FULL (via user policy)
# - Charlie (other researcher): READ (via researchers group)
#
# KEY POINT:
# Multiple users can have independent policies for the same folder.
# Each user's policy is separate and doesn't affect others.
