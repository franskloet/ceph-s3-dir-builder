# Example with explicit group definitions
# Shows two ways to define group memberships

bucket: department-storage
create_bucket: true
create_directories: true
create_users: true
create_groups: true  # Set to false if groups already exist

# Method 1: Define groups with their members (recommended)
groups:
  # Simple list format
  admin-group: [alice, admin]
  
  # Or detailed format (for future extensibility)
  researchers:
    members: [alice, bob, charlie]
  
  data-team:
    members: [charlie, david]

# Method 2: Map users to groups (alternative)
# Note: You can use both methods, they complement each other
