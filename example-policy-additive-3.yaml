# Example 3: Simplified Alice Access - No Group Re-specification Needed
# This demonstrates that you DON'T need to re-specify the researchers group
# because user and group policies are independent.
# 
# Run after example-policy-additive-1.yaml
# 
# Result: 
# - Researchers group keeps its read access from config 1
# - Alice gets additional full access via user policy
# - Both policies coexist independently

bucket: team-storage
tenant: sils_mns
create_bucket: false
create_directories: false  # Already created by config 1
create_users: false
create_groups: false  # Groups already exist from first config

directories:
  name: ""  # Root
  children:
    # Alice's personal workspace
    - name: users
      children:
        - name: alice
          access:
            level: full
            users: [alice]
    
    # SIMPLIFIED: Just add Alice's access to the experiment folder
    # No need to re-specify the researchers group!
    # The researchers group policy from config 1 remains active
    - name: projects
      children:
        - name: experiment-2024
          access:
            level: full
            users: [alice]  # Only specify Alice

# What happens:
# 
# After config 1 runs:
#   - researchers GROUP has policy: s3-team-storage-projects-experiment-2024 (read)
# 
# After config 2 runs:
#   - researchers GROUP still has: s3-team-storage-projects-experiment-2024 (read)
#   - alice USER has policy: (policy name varies by implementation) (full)
# 
# Result for Alice (member of researchers group):
#   - Gets read access via researchers group membership
#   - Gets full access via direct user policy
#   - Effective access: FULL (policies are combined, most permissive wins)
# 
# Result for Bob (member of researchers group):
#   - Gets read access via researchers group membership
#   - No direct user policy
#   - Effective access: READ
# 
# IMPORTANT: This works because:
# 1. User policies and group policies are separate IAM entities
# 2. IAM combines all applicable policies (union of permissions)
# 3. You don't need to re-specify existing group access when adding user access
